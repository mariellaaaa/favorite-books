                                                    The 10X rule is based on the idea you should figure out what you want to do, what goal you have, be it making a certain amount of money, finding your ideal loved one, achieving a certain body fat percentage, and multiply the effort and time you think it’ll take to do by 10. That way you have a more accurate idea of how much time and effort it will actually take. And if it doesn’t take 10 times more effort then you anticipated, great. It’s better to be pleasantly surprised then greatly disappointed. This is just one part of the 10X rule though. On the other side of the coin Is 10X thinking. And that is when you take for example, how much money you want to earn, say $100,000, you should multiply that by 10, and figure out the steps you’ll want to take and the amount of time it will take to get that goal. If you fall short of that 10X goal, there’s a pretty high chance you’ll be above your original goal. And it feels better to fall short on a massive goal then it does to fall short on a mediocre one. We as humans have a tendency to underestimate what we can accomplish, and therefore set lower goals and not reach our full potential. When you apply the 10x rule to your thinking, and then apply the 10X rule to how you act as well, success is guaranteed.
